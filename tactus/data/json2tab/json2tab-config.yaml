# Configuration file for Wind Turbine Location Processing
# All paths can be absolute or relative to the script location

# Input data configuration
input:
  # Main GeoJSON file containing turbine locations
  turbine_locations: "{TO BE SET BY DEODE-WORKFLOW}"
  # Optional: Database with turbine specifications
  turbine_database: "{TO BE SET BY DEODE-WORKFLOW}"



# Subsetting configuration
subsetting:
  # Filter turbines in temporal domain with installation/decommissioning date; possible values: a valid date, "today" (default) or "all"
  situation_date: "{TO BE SET BY DEODE-WORKFLOW}"

  # Spatial cropping method; can be either "bbox" (bounding box) or "domain" (TOML-based domain)
  method: "domain"
  
# Turbine matcher configuration
matcher:
  use_probabilistic_mapper: false
  use_default_selector: false
  forbidden_types: "999;9999" #"999" # List of forbidden tubine types, i.e. turbine types that should be treated as unknown turbine types and matching logic should be applied to find correct turbine type

# Output configuration
output:
  # Directory for all output files
  directory: "{TO BE SET BY DEODE-WORKFLOW}"
  # Output files configuration
