### New features

(This first tagged version of) `deode` is able to perform forecast generation
tailored to high-resolution simulations (with AROME CY48t3 and HARMONIE-AROME
CY46h1) on ATOS with output being archived in ECFS (including log files).

Missing things: no cleaning of post-mortem files, no extraction for
verification, not yet able to run on LUMI.
